# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNNs
A deep learning project that classifies CIFAR-10 images using a custom CNN with CutMix, DropBlock, and Label Smoothing. Achieved 91% accuracy.

# Tools & Libraries
- Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib

# Project Highlights
- Applied data augmentation and advanced regularization
- Used CosineAnnealingLR for learning rate scheduling
- Visualized training/validation accuracy and confusion matrix

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the notebook
3. Run all cells (Python 3, GPU recommended)

# Results
   91.46% test accuracy on CIFAR-10  
   Includes training graphs.
